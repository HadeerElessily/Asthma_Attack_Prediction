# Asthma Attack Prediction and Management
This project aims to predict asthma attacks using a machine learning model and provide a user-friendly interface through a Flutter mobile app. The predictive 
model is built using Python's machine learning libraries, and the user interface is created using Flutter. The communication between the mobile app and the
predictive model is established using a Flask API.

### Introduction
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of asthma attacks can significantly improve patient management and reduce the severity of attacks. This project focuses on building a predictive model that utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast asthma attacks based on relevant input features.

The Flutter mobile app provides an intuitive user interface for users to input their health data. This data is then sent to the Flask API, which interacts with the predictive model. The model processes the input and returns the likelihood of an impending asthma attack. The app displays this information to the user in a clear and understandable manner.
